**Kundli Analysis Engine**

### 1.1 Core charts and tables (the backbone)

* D1 (Rāshi / Lagna chart): main life outcomes (career, marriage, money, health)

* D9 (Navāṁśa): confirms strength of planets \+ marriage quality \+ dharma maturity

* Bhava Chalit: corrects which *house* a planet truly influences (house cusps vs sign houses)

* Planetary positions: sign, degree, nakshatra, pada, retrograde/combust (if provided)

* Aspects & conjunctions: who influences whom

* Ashtakvarga: “probability strength map” for signs/houses

### 1.2 Timing engines (to answer “WHEN?”)

* Vimshottari Dasha: life chapters (Mahadasha/Antardasha/Pratyantar)

* Yogini Dasha: secondary confirmation timing

* Jaimini blocks: Chara Karakas \+ Char Dasha (event-style activation)

* Varshaphal (Solar Return) \+ Muntha: year lens \+ monthly-ish windows

### 1.3 Dosha / special checks (risk flags)

* Manglik (Mangal Dosha): marriage friction risk

* Sade Sati / Panoti: Saturn-on-Moon stress windows

* Kalsarpa: all planets trapped between Rahu–Ketu axis (yes/no)

## 2\) The Golden Rule

Every life question is answered by combining:

House (topic) \+ House Lord (controller) \+ Karaka (natural significator) \+ Timing (dasha/transit/year)

## 3\) The Full Workflow (in the exact order)

### Step 0 — Input checklist (what you need from any chart)

Minimum:

* Birth details (date, time, place)

* D1 chart

* D9 chart

* Vimshottari timeline

* Bhava Chalit, Ashtakvarga, Varshaphal, Jaimini blocks

### Step 1 — Birth data sanity checks

### This prevents “confident but incorrect astrology”

* If Asc degree is near sign boundary or house cusp → rely more on Bhava Chalit.

* Cross-check chart with known life events (education year, job start, relocation, major breakup).

### Step 2 — Build the life “skeleton” once (permanent profile)

This is your base model of the person:

* Lagna sign \+ Lagna lord: personality, life direction, default path

* Moon sign \+ Moon nakshatra/pada: mind, emotional reflexes, focus style

* Sun condition: ego, authority, father/power themes

* Saturn condition: discipline, long-term rise, struggle patterns

* 10th house & 10th lord: career engine

* 2nd \+ 11th houses: money engine

* 7th house \+ Venus \+ D9: marriage engine

### Step 3 — Planet grading (the “permission to deliver results” test)

For any planet relevant to a question, grade it using this grid:

Planet Strength Grid

1. Dignity: exalted / own / friendly / neutral / enemy / debilitated

2. House type:

   * Strong: Kendra (1/4/7/10), Trikona (1/5/9)

   * Growth: Upachaya (3/6/10/11)

   * Challenging: Dusthana (6/8/12)

3. Aspects & conjunctions:

   * Benefic support (Jupiter/Venus/Mercury well-placed)

   * Malefic pressure (Saturn/Mars/Rahu-Ketu impact)

4. Dispositor chain: planet → sign lord → (optional nakshatra lord)

5. Chalit correction: confirm which house it truly influences

6. Ashtakvarga support: is the relevant sign/house “supported”?

7. D9 confirmation: does it remain strong in Navāṁśa?

Output of Step 3: Each planet becomes: Strong / Medium / Weak with reasons.

### Step 4 — Category answer logic (house \+ lord \+ karaka)

For the life topic:

* Identify the main house(s)

* Identify the house lord(s)

* Identify the karaka planet(s)

* Evaluate each via Step 3

### Step 5 — Timing (convert “can happen” into “will happen now”)

Use hierarchy:

1. Vimshottari (primary)

2. Jaimini Char Dasha (event triggers)

3. Varshaphal \+ Muntha (this-year activation)

4. Transits (Saturn/Jupiter/Rahu-Ketu triggers)

## 4\) The Category Packs (methods per life area)

Each category below has:

* Houses (what to check)

* Lords (controllers)

* Karakas (natural significators)

* Common decision rules

### A) Mind, focus, emotional pattern

Check: 1st house, Moon, Mercury, 5th house  
 Karakas: Moon (mind), Mercury (thinking), Saturn (discipline), Rahu (restlessness)  
 Rules:

* Moon afflicted \+ Rahu/Saturn influence → distraction / overthinking

* Strong Mercury \+ strong 5th → learning clarity and pattern detection

### B) Education, exams, learning

Check: 4th, 5th, 9th; Mercury, Jupiter  
 Rules:

* Strong 5th \+ Mercury → exam performance and comprehension

* 9th \+ Jupiter strong → admissions luck, mentors, scholarships

* Bad dasha of 4/5/9 lords → fog, inconsistency

### C) Career (job vs entrepreneurship)

Job: 6th (service/competition) \+ 10th (work)  
 Business: 7th (trade/public/clients) \+ 10th (execution)  
 Also check: 11th (income), Saturn (workload), Sun (authority)  
 Rules:

* 10th strong \+ Saturn strong → slow burn, big title

* 7th strong \+ Mercury/Rahu strong → business/market leverage

* 6th strong → winning interviews/competition, stable job path

### D) Money, wealth, investing, “how rich?”

Check: 2nd (savings), 11th (income), 5th (speculation), 8th (risk), 9th (fortune)  
 Karakas: Jupiter (wealth wisdom), Venus (comfort/luxury), Mercury (trade), Saturn (long compounding)  
 Rules:

* 2nd+11th strong → steady compounding

* 5th strong → investing skill

* 8th afflicted \+ bad dasha → drawdowns/sudden expenses

### E) Marriage, partner traits, loyalty, stability

Check: 7th, 7th lord, Venus, D9 (Navāṁśa)  
 Extra: Manglik, Rahu/Ketu influence on 7th/Venus  
 Rules:

* D1 shows “marriage event”; D9 shows “marriage quality”

* Manglik is not doom: check cancellations \+ D9 support

* Rahu on 7th/Venus → unconventional attraction patterns; needs maturity

### F) Health, disease, brain fog, chronic patterns

Check: 1st (constitution), 6th (disease), 8th (chronic), 12th (sleep/loss)  
 Rules:

* Health event needs (house trigger) \+ (dasha trigger)

* Moon+Saturn/Rahu periods → brain fog, anxiety, sleep disruption

### G) Family, home peace, parents, siblings

Check: 2nd (family), 4th (home/mother), 9th (father/fortune), 3rd (siblings)  
 Rules:

* 4th afflicted → restlessness even when successful

* 9th strong → mentors/father blessings, protection

### H) Children

Check: 5th house, 5th lord, Jupiter; (advanced: D7)  
 Rules:

* 5th/Jupiter dashas often bring conception/child milestones

### I) Foreign travel, settlement, USA/abroad

Check: 9th (distance), 12th (foreign stay), Rahu (foreignness), 7th (via partner/business)  
 Rules:

* Foreign stay often appears when 12th activates and 9th or Rahu supports

### J) Spirituality, tantra compatibility, mantra fruit

Check: 9th (dharma), 12th (moksha), 8th (occult), Ketu (detachment)  
 Rules:

* Occult grows when 8th \+ Ketu activate AND Moon is stable

* If Moon weak → stabilize mind before “power practices”

### K) Enemies, litigation, competition

Check: 6th (enemies), 11th (victory), 3rd (courage), Mars/Saturn  
 Rules:

* Strong 6th → ability to win conflicts, but can increase stress

## 5\) The Scoring System (so outputs are consistent and model-trainable)

To remove “vibes”, use a numeric score:

For any question, score the 4 pillars (0–3 each):

1. House strength (0–3)

2. House lord strength (0–3)

3. Karaka strength (0–3)

4. Timing strength (0–3)

Total 0–12 output map

* 0–4: low probability / delay / avoid

* 5–8: mixed / conditional / needs work

* 9–12: high probability / supportive period

This single rubric makes astrology outputs repeatable.

---

## 6\) “WHEN exactly?” (Timing rules you can teach a model)

### Timing Rule \#1 — Dasha is the primary gate

A topic manifests when dasha lords connect to topic houses/lords/karakas.

Example:

* Marriage windows often come when 7th lord / Venus / D9 triggers appear in dasha.

### Timing Rule \#2 — Transits are the trigger, not the script

Use transits to activate what dasha already permits.

### Timing Rule \#3 — Varshaphal/Muntha is the “this year” lens

If someone asks “Will it happen this year?”

* Check the Muntha house (dominant theme)

* Check Varshaphal mini-periods (month windows)

---

## 7\) Dosha logic (how to avoid fear-mongering)

### Manglik (Mangal Dosha)

* Identify Mars placement from Lagna and Moon

* Then check cancellation/support:

  * Mars dignity strong

  * Benefic aspects

  * 7th lord strong

  * D9 supportive

### Sade Sati

* Use it as a stress amplifier, not automatic doom

* Severity depends on Saturn’s role \+ ongoing dasha

### Kalsarpa

* Binary detection is crude

* Judge real-world impact using:

  * Strength of Rahu/Ketu dispositors

  * House placements

  * Dasha timing

## 8\) How to train “another model” using this document

If your goal is to teach another system (LLM or rule engine), do it in layers.

### Layer 1 — Data schema (structure your dataset)

Each example record should include:

* D1 placements (planet → sign → house, degrees optional)

* D9 placements

* Bhava Chalit house mapping

* Dasha timeline (current \+ next 2–3)

* Ashtakvarga scores (if used)

* Question category label (career/marriage/etc.)

* Final output label (Good/Mixed/Bad \+ 0–12 score)

### Layer 2 — Labeling guideline (make outputs consistent)

For each training example, store:

* Which houses were used

* Which lords were used

* Which karakas were used

* Why strength was assigned (dignity/house/aspects)

* Timing reason (dasha link)

### Layer 3 — Prompt template (for inference)

Use this format:

Input:

* Category

* D1/D9 summary

* Dasha running

* Ashtakvarga if available

Required output:

1. House analysis (with score)

2. Lord analysis (with score)

3. Karaka analysis (with score)

4. Timing analysis (with score)

5. Final probability bucket (0–12)

6. Next 2 timing windows (if asked)

### Layer 4 — Evaluation (so you know the model works)

Test on:

* Consistency: same chart \+ same question → same score

* Explainability: produces the 4-pillar breakdown

* Calibration: “Mixed” predictions shouldn’t be overly confident

## 9\) “One-page cheat sheet” your friends can memorize

Answer \= House \+ Lord \+ Karaka \+ Timing  
 Strength \= dignity \+ house type \+ aspects \+ dispositor \+ D9  
 When \= dasha permission \+ transit trigger \+ yearly confirmation
